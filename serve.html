				<h2>Ways You Can Help:</h2>

				<div class="loveDoes">
					<img src="dist/img/loveDoes.jpg" alt="">
					<h3>Love Does</h3>
					<p>God has birthed a simple idea for how we can love our city. 
						Grace Klein Community has simple, business-size cards to be used for 
						random acts of kindness all over Birmingham. These cards can be 
						collected from our office.</p>
						<p>Simply think up some random acts of kindness and give out 
						these cards as you do. Our hope is that these cards will inspire 
						others to share and do their own random acts of kindness.</p>
						<ul>
							<h4>Some Ideas</h4>
							<li>Take cookies to the DMV</li>
							<li>Pay for the order behind you in a drive thru</li>
							<li>Wrap some knick knacks and deliver them to a local nursing home for the residents</li>
							<li>When it’s cold, deliver a thermos of hot coffee or cocoa to an outdoor construction crew; when it’s hot, take some popsicles or lemonade</li>
							<li>Take a widow or single mom and her kids out to dinner to somewhere they have never been</li>
						</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="garden">
					<img src="dist/img/garden.jpg" alt="">
					<h3>Community Garden</h3>
					<p> A community garden is a visual story of 
					life in sin, battle, freedom, waiting, trust and Jesus. </p>
					<p>We were hoping to find a good spot in the backyard of GKC where food 
						could be grown that we could all give away.</p>
					<p>A community garden is for the community. Anyone can go grab a 
						squash for dinner or some jalapeño peppers. Community shares 
						and the more okra we pick, the more it grows. We preserve the
						tomatoes for the spaghetti sauce at prayer night or bring 
						banana peppers for the salad at a ladies night out. We 
						share the food with the volunteer that stops by, short on 
						groceries this month. We add a random assortment of produce
						to the thirty food boxes that were delivered from the 
						office last week. Whoever needs it, it’s yours.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="giveTakeRoom">
					<img src="dist/img/giveTake2.jpg" alt="">
					<h3>Give and Take Room</h3>
					<p>Rather than phrases like “donation room” or “donation center”, 
						we like to use “give and take room.” We want to encourage everyone 
						involved in Grace Klein Community to both give and take so that it 
						becomes a true reciprocal community.</p>
					<p>What if your kid has outgrown some clothes? Bring the old ones to 
						give and look through the Give and Take room to find the new sizes he/she needs.</p>
						
					<p>There are no guarantees that you’ll find what you need, but we have seen 
					countless instances where someone prayed or asked for a specific item and 
					it showed up within days or weeks. Some of the random requests that have showed
					up… ice cream bowls, computer monitors, bunk beds, shoes of a specific size, 
					brand and color, air mattress, tent, home-school books, musical instruments, 
					canning jars, and the list goes on and on.</p>
				</div>
